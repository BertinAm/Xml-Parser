# XML-Parser


The XML-Parser is a Python program that allows you to open an XML file, parse its content, clean the extracted data, and generate a new XML file with the cleaned content. It uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and provides an easy-to-use interface for selecting and processing XML files.

### How to Run

To run the XML-Parser program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3 or above).

2. Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   pip install tkinter
   ```

3. Download the program files and save them in a directory.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the program files are located.

5. Run the following command to start the program:
   ```
   python program_name.py
   ```
   Replace `program_name.py` with the actual name of the Python script containing the program code.

6. The XML-Parser GUI window will open. Click the "Open XML File" button to select an XML file for processing.

7. If the XML file is valid, you will be prompted to save the generated XML file. Choose a location and enter a file name.

8. The program will generate the cleaned XML file and display the original XML content and the cleaned content in separate text widgets.

### Required Libraries

The XML-Parser program requires the following libraries:

- Tkinter: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) and file dialog functionality. It is usually included with standard Python installations.

### Program Structure

The program consists of the following files:

- `program_name.py`: Contains the main code for the XML Generator program.
- `validate.py`: Contains functions for XML validation.
- `parse.py`: Contains the Parser class for extracting content from XML.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, which provides an overview of the program and instructions for running it.
